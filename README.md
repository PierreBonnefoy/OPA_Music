## Choice of the Subject
We initialy chose to realize a streaming platform for music using the Youtube 
API. But, by the fact that we can't only retrieve the audio only version of 
Youtube videos, the project became a alternative youtube client in wich you can
search every video on Youtube and add it to your favorites to keep them safe.
