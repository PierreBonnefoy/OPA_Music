# Project Retrospective

## Project State
### Positive Points
- We implemented almost all the features we wanted to have.
- Pretty frontend.

### Negative Points
- The fact that the Vue JS client and Spring Server are not hosted on the same server.
- Playlist system wich is not reading the next video automatically.

## Difficulty encoutered
### Authentication System
For the Vue JS client, we needed to implement a JWT Token for authentication. This was long and pretty difficult for us.

### Security
The learning of Spring Security have caused us a lot of problems, and was obviously creating a lot of bugs to fix.

### Youtube API Implementation
Understanding the data what we received from the API and use it.

### Playlist Management
We had a lot of difficulties to modelize the database in order to store our playlists. 

## What did we learn ?
This project allowed us to learn some more recent web technologies. In comparison of our past project, we have been able to use frameworks (Spring Boot and Vue JS) that are used more and more nowadays. This permit us to enhance our Web Technologies Knowledge. We also have been able to force us to code in English wich is a very interesting point for the Enterprise World.

## Project Lessons
### What would we change ?
We think that we could have been able to automatize some tests so we want to make it in a our future projects. A


### What would we keep ?
We think our work organisation was pretty good such as every body have done a part wich he was interested about.
Also we think our working attitude was good such as we haven't had any different between the group members. 
Our GitHub Commit Policy was also a good point, we think that our commit messages were clear.
